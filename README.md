LAS2peer-Sample-Service
=======================

A sample service that shows the basic configuration of a LAS2peer project

To experiment with it, just run ant all and start the network with start_SingleLAS2peerService.bat.

This Project comes with additional start scripts:

start_ServiceAgentGenerator.bat: This can be used to create xml-Agent Files for new Services.

start_UserAgentGenerator.bat: This can be used to create a new xml-UserAgent File.

start_network.bat: This script starts the LAS2peerNodeLauncher tool, which can be used after the library restructuring is finished.
With the current project setup it is not usable, but this project will be updated when restructuring is finished.
